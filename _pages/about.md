- I am a postdoctoral researcher at the European Brain Research Institute [(EBRI)](https://www.ebri.it/en/)
 in the Bioinformatics Lab, and a visiting scientist at the Scuola Normale Superiore in [Francesco Raimondo’s group](https://bioinfolab.sns.it/). My research applies machine and deep learning to RNA-seq (bulk and single-cell), clinical, and proteomic data from neurodegenerative diseases and cancer. In cancer, I focus on single-cell RNA-seq to study patient responses to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), aiming to improve diagnostics, prediction, and pathway discovery.

- I obtained a Master’s in High Performance Computing [(MHPC)](https://www.mhpc.it/) from [ICTP](https://www.ictp.it/) and [SISSA](https://www.sissa.it/). The program provided in-depth training in parallel computing, HPC architecture, performance optimization, and scientific computing.

- I have a PhD in Theoretical High Energy Physics joint with [Bogazici University](https://bogazici.edu.tr/en) and ICTP. I managed to quantum tunnel through wildly different fields—starting with three-dimensional massive supergravity solutions, exploring exotic supersymmetric configurations that sparked my curiosity. Then, I dove into the mysterious world of integrable models via the gauge/Yang-Baxter equation correspondence, bridging supersymmetric gauge theories and exactly solvable statistical models. Finally, I quantum-leaped into simulating oscillons in the early universe using GRChombo, watching tiny localized energy lumps collapse into black holes. My research journey looks like a superposition of supergravity, integrability, and numerical relativity, through different phases.
