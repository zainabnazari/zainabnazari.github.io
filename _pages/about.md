Welcome to my webpage!

I am a researcher affiliated with the  [European Brain Research Institute (EBRI)](https://www.ebri.it/) Bioinformatics lab.

My academic background spans Theoretical High Energy Physics, and High Performance Computing. 

My primary research focus involves leveraging RNA sequencing, clinical data, and proteomic information through advanced machine learning techniques. This endeavor is aimed at achieving more precise diagnostics, predictive modeling, and a profound comprehension of neurodegenerative diseases, particularly Parkinson's.
