- I am a postdoctoral researcher at the European Brain Research Institute (EBRI) in the Bioinformatics Lab, and a visiting scientist at the Scuola Normale Superiore in Francesco Raimondo’s group. My research applies machine and deep learning to RNA-seq (bulk and single-cell), clinical, and proteomic data from neurodegenerative diseases and cancer. In cancer, I focus on single-cell RNA-seq to study patient responses to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), aiming to improve diagnostics, prediction, and pathway discovery.

- I obtained a Master’s in High Performance Computing (MHPC) from ICTP and SISSA. The program provided in-depth training in parallel computing, HPC architecture, performance optimization, and scientific computing.

- I have a PhD in Theoretical High Energy Physics. I managed to quantum tunnel through wildly different fields—starting with three-dimensional massive supergravity solutions, exploring exotic supersymmetric configurations that sparked my curiosity. Then, I dove into the mysterious world of integrable models via the gauge/Yang-Baxter equation correspondence, bridging supersymmetric gauge theories and exactly solvable statistical models. Finally, I then quantum-leaped into simulating oscillons in the early universe using GRChombo, watching tiny localized energy lumps collapse into black holes. My research journey looks like a superposition of supergravity, integrability, and numerical relativity, through different phases.
