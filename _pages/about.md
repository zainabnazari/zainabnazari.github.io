Hi and welcome to my webpage! I am a  bioinformatics researcher at the [European Brain Research Institute (EBRI)](https://www.ebri.it/), with a background in Theoretical High Energy Physics and a student of [Master in High Performance Computing] (https://www.mhpc.it/) at ICTP-SISSA. My current focus is on utilizing RNA sequencing data and machine learning techniques aiming for more accurate diagnosis and a deeper understanding of Parkinson's disease, and other neurodegenerative diseases.
